- At the time of beginning this project (2022-10-31), my knowledge and understanding of the R programming language is extremely rudimentary. For this reason, I will be doing this project in the R programming language for the entirety of the project even when I would otherwise use alternative tools. 

- I will being writing this document as if I were preparing it for my team for feedback as well as an account of my analysis for replication purposes.

- Urška Sršen, a co-founder and the Chief Creative Oﬃcer of Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused
products for women, asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices.
